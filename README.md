## Setting up the environment

### Prerequisites 
These have to be installed before installing COSMOS.

1. Visual Studio
2. Visual Studio Workload: .NET Core Tools
3. .NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack 
4. VMWare Player

### Note 
1. I haven't mentioned the versions here because it is advised to use the latest version of it at the time of you viewing this project.
2. COSMOS only works with VMWare Player. So, VirtualBox, etc won't work.

After installing all the pre-requisites, install COSMOS from here. Make sure VS is not running.
https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/releases/tag/Userkit_20190628

Now, if COSMOS installed for you, great! Skip to the next part.  
If not, don't worry. We were in a similar situation and here is a work-around for it.

1. Clone this repository  
https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos
2. Run the install-VS2019.bat file from the repository
3. Simply import any demo project from the 'Demos' folder in VS.

Now, VS automatically detects the missing files and stuff and does the installing for you. Just go through the setup.
